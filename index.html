  <h2>Bio/Introduction</h2>

  <p>I moved to Pittsburgh from Virginia in 2019 for school. I believe in contributing to the communities I live, work, and play in. I previously have done a software engineering internship at SMS Group, and I also have worked at the non-profit Venture Outdoors as a supervisor and trip leader for their Kayak Pittsburgh project. In the past I have volunteered with iServe at Pitt teaching coding skills to grade schoolers in the Homewood and Hill District neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. Technology offers a gateway to opportunity, and I want to be able to use my knowledge and skills to open to the communities around me as much as possible. I also am interested exploring in the ways that technology provides accesibility to artistic experiences.</p>


<p>Outside of work I enjoy playing music, sewing, and skateboarding.</p>
